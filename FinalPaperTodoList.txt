1. Abstract
2. Background
3. Related Work/Bibliography
4. Methodology
4.1. Overview - Describe the high level of the algo
4.2. Segmentation.
-> Wav file -> array of amplitudes.
-> Fixed size segment
-> Each segment can either be 0-9 or a-z
-> We try different value an determine the best one manually
-> picture
4.3. Collect data.
-> Locate the fixed size window of each spoken digit/letters based on the manual transcription.
-> In the manu transcription,
-> May introduce offset shift -> increase the ammount of data
                 -> increase the accuracy (number)
4.4. Feature Extration
-> Raw data: 
-> MFCC: 
-> Apply PCA: -> reduce time/the accuracy increase in some case.
4.5. Train single digit/letter classifier.
-> SVM
-> KNN
-> We have nice libary
4.6. Get the potential offset spoken location
-> We already know the window. Pick the windows where (max - min) are maximum or the std are maximum.
5. Experiment
5.1. Datasets generated by the library. How we generated it.
5.2. Three kinds of data. 
    -> digit
    -> digit/letter
    -> digit distored
5.3. Single Digit Classifier -> Well
5.4. Number of train data/number of test data. Shift when train. x100
5.5. Accuracy with different method combination
6. Conclusion
-> MFCC is great
-> SVM vs KNN
-> PCA
-> What are the best options?
7. Future work
-> Modify MFCC to get better/RASTA-LPL feature extraction
-> Try with longer captcha
-> Unknow number of characters captcha. 
    -> Different data collection methodology/ data for noise
    -> Different segmentation algo/different method to get potential location of spoken digit/letter
